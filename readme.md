    WIT-Calendar is a chrome extension that makes adding your classes to your calendar easy & quick! In the future you can also find "best times" to meet with fellow students, easily register for classes, and more!
</p>

## How does it work?
The chrome extension gets your schedule, processes it, and then provides you with a calendar link. You can also optionally connect your Google account for automatic updates to your Google Calendar.

You can also manage event alerts, colors, and titles from within the extension.

## Development
- See instructions for developing up the extension [here](https://github.com/WITCodingClub/calendar/blob/main/client/README.md).
- See instructions for developing up the backend [here](https://github.com/jaspermayone/witcc-calendar-backend/blob/main/README.md).

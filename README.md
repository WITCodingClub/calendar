## Description
WIT-Calendar is a Chrome extension that makes adding your classes to your calendar easy & quick!
It supports all major calendars, including Google Calendar, Microsoft Outlook, and Apple Calendar.
In the future, you will also be able to find "best times" to meet with fellow students, easily register for classes, and more!

## How does it work?
The Chrome extension gets your schedule, processes it, and then provides you with a calendar link. You can also optionally connect your Google account for automatic updates to your Google Calendar.

You can also manage event alerts, colors, and titles from within the extension.

## Development
- See instructions for developing the extension [here](https://github.com/WITCodingClub/calendar/blob/main/client/README.md).

- See instructions for developing the backend [here](https://github.com/WITCodingClub/calendar-backend/blob/main/README.md).
